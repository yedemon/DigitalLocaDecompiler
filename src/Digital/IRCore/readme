Theoretically, it should include an AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) directory and Items. 
However, to simplify the directory hierarchy, AST and Items have not been moved under this structure.

This sits between Script and PCode, encompassing registered objects (Items) as well as the equivalent AST for functions.

Its structure can be generated from either a PcodeBlock or a ScriptBlock. 
It serves as an abstract intermediate layer.
